# Analysis of multivarite point patterns with INLA

The code in this repository fits multivariate models to marked point patterns from case-control data. In addition, exposure to pollution soures can be assessed by including different terms on the distance to the putative source.

The methodology is described in this [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/submit/2629886):
